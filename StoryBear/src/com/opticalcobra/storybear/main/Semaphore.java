  History:
  Date       Who                What
  11Jun1998  dl               Create public version
   5Aug1998  dl               replaced int counters with longs
  24Aug1999  dl               release(n): screen arguments


  This is a slightly adapted and simplified version for the use in
  the operating systems lecture Dual Hochschule Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.
  
  The method names were adjusted to the lecture
  instead of acquire() we use down()
  instead of release() we use up()

/**
 * Base class for counting semaphores.
 * Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits.
 * Each up() blocks if necessary
 * until a permit is available, and then takes it. 
 * Each down() adds a permit. However, no actual permit objects
 * are used; the Semaphore just keeps a count of the number
 * available and acts accordingly.
 * <p>
 * A semaphore initialized to 1 can serve as a mutual exclusion
 * lock. 
 * <p>
 * This implementation makes NO 
 * guarantees about the order in which threads will 
 * acquire permits
